This is the first project for the nanodegree project on Udacity.

This project is connected to the Intro to HTML and CSS course but depending on your background knowledge of HTML and CSS you may not need to take the whole thing to complete this project. Here's what you should do:

1. Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section to your lower right hand corner and review it.
2. Identify the various elements you will need to build in order to recreate this design using Twitter's Bootstrap          framework.
3. In the Project Coding Environment node write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work reaches a mismatch of 8% or less. Make sure to read the instructor notes for important information regarding specific naming conventions.
